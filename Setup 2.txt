#Pihole and Unbound
#We can now add extra privacy fetures to pihole usinge unbound.
#There are some extra steps involved in setting up this up as the documentaion
#discribeds an instace of pihole with unbound on the host.

#Prerequisitse
#Have pihole running as a container with network host access and wth web port something other than 80. 
#Ive used port 8080 in the doker compose example.

#With pihole up and running we can now setup unbound.
#Unbound is available in most package managers. 

#For debain simply run the following to install unbound.
sudo apt install unbound

#If you run.
sudo systemctl ststus unbound

#You will see that unbound has failed to start.
#This is because by default unbound works on port 53 but it is already allocated to the pihole comntainer.
#Now we can configure unbound to work on port 5335.

#Make the following config file with.
sudo nano /etc/unbound/unbound.conf.d/pi-hole.conf

#This means that unbound is working

#IMPORTANT remember to have the upstream dns server in pihole set to.
127.0.0.1#5335
#This will ensure all dns quieries from pihole go to unbound and then to the authoritative dns server.
#But is you set up pihole with the docker compose file it should be setup already.

#Your first quieries will be slow as unbound is searching for the resolts to forward to pihole.
#Once the quieries are awnsered pihole will cache the awnsers and lookups will be alot quicker for those domains.

#In pihole you should see quieries being awnsered like so.
